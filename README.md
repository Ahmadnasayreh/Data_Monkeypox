Deep Learning Model Development: Employed deep learning and transfer learning techniques, evaluating five pretrained models (VGG19, VGG16, ResNet50, MobileNetV2, and EfficientNetB3) using accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-score.
Comprehensive Methodology: Included data collection, preprocessing with image augmentation, and extensive model training and validation.
Superior Performance: MobileNetV2 achieved the best performance with an accuracy of 98.16%, recall of 0.96, precision of 0.99, and an F1-score of 0.98, significantly outperforming existing methods.
